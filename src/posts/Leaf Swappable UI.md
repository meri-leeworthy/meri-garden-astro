> [!NOTE] Meri's summary
> swappable UI is really important for the long term goals where users are creatively empowered to design their own data-world-systems, kind of like a powerful CMS or a PKM, but critically with no limitations on extending these capabilities to multiplayer settings like group messaging
> Itâ€™s also a bit of an emerging tech space with a lot of unknowns / complex factors around security and performance. We can start small though and introduce progressively more powerful capabilities as we prove viability and as the tech standards (like the component model) continue to advance

[[conversation with Zicklag about Swappable UI, ECS and compute abstractions]]


> [!NOTE] Further reflections
> Where *render plugins* can abstract over the potential output of apps built on Leaf, swappable *UI plugins* represent an abstraction over the app itself. Leaf and the app-container then becomes more like an operating system, comparable to iOS and the iPhone, but built on and benefiting from open standards and platforms like the Web.
