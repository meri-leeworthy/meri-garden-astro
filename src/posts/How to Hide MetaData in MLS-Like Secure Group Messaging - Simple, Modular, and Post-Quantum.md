# Notes

Since the publication of this paper, the MLS spec was published as [[RFC 9420 - The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol|RFC 9420]]. Some notable changes include **MLSPlaintext** and **MLSCiphertext** messages being renamed to **PublicMessage** and **PrivateMessage**.

## Notation

$F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ - ideal functionality capturing the correctness and security guarantee of **dynamic metadata-hiding CGKA**

$F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$  - restricted ideal functionality, roughly captures a **static metadata-hiding CGKA** with leakage functions defining what metadata is leaked

$F_{CGKA}$ normal ideal UC-secure CGKA

$\prod_{ctxt}$ an arbitrary CGKA

$W^{mh}$ - wrapper protocol with the following properties: 
- (1) Anonymous upload. A group member id can anonymously upload a proposal p or a commit ($c_0$, ®c) to the server. 
- (2) Anonymous download. A group member id can anonymously download a commit ($c_0$, ®c) from the server. 
- (3) Unlinkability. A member performing multiple uploads and downloads remains unlinkable from the server. 
- (4) Group authentication. Only members of the group — excluding the honest server — can upload to and download from the server
- Members can also *selectively* download partial commits while retaining total anonymity. Finally, the wrapper protocol inherits the *compromise resilience* (FS and PCS) guarantees from underlying the CGKA.

## Abstract
Secure group messaging (SGM) protocols allow large groups of users to communicate in a secure and asynchronous manner. In recent years, continuous group key agreements (CGKAs) have provided a powerful abstraction to reason on the security properties we expect from SGM protocols. While robust techniques have been developed to protect the contents of conversations in this context, it is in general more challenging to protect metadata (e.g. the identity and social relationships of group members), since their knowledge is often needed by the server in order to ensure the proper function of the SGM protocol. 

==In this work, we provide a simple and generic wrapper protocol that upgrades non-metadata-hiding CGKAs into metadata-hiding CGKAs. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of a unique continuously evolving group secret key shared among the group members. We use this key to perform a group membership authentication protocol that convinces the server in an anonymous manner that a user is a legitimate group member.== Our technique only uses a standard signature scheme, and thus, the wrapper protocol can be instantiated from a wide range of assumptions, including post-quantum ones. It is also very efficient, as it increases the bandw$id_t$h cost of the underlying CGKA operations by at most a factor of two. 

To formally prove the security of our protocol, we use the universal composability (UC) framework and model a new ==ideal functionality $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ capturing the correctness and security guarantee of metadata-hiding CGKA==. To capture the above intuition of a “wrapper” protocol, we also define a ==restricted ideal functionality $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$, which roughly captures a non-metadata-hiding CGKA==. We then show that our wrapper protocol UC-realizes $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ in the $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$- hybrid model, which in particular formalizes the intuition that ==any non-metadata-hiding CGKA can be modularly bootstrapped into metadata-hiding CGKA==.

## 1 Introduction

A secure group messaging (SGM) protocol allows a group of users to asynchronously communicate in an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) fashion. With the advent of Signal, SGM protocols have seen exponential growth in practical use, and currently, IETF is almost finished standardizing the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) SGM protocol [14] known to offer good scalability properties. 

The baseline security notion guaranteed by all SGM protocols is that no adversary, including the server, should be able to read the messages sent among the group members. However, this does not prevent the adversary from collecting metadata, such as the identities of the sender and of other group members, which can both be leaked from the exchanged encrypted contents. It has been shown in numerous real-world scenarios [23, 34 , 49 , 51 , 54] that knowledge of metadata alone can cause damaging repercussions, sometimes enough to defeat the purpose of using SGM protocols. These also have negative impacts on the activity and safety of some users, e.g., journalists and activists [47 , 48 ]. Recent media articles [ 18 , 42 ] report that, in the United States, metadata collection by law enforcement agencies on secure messaging applications is a widespread practice, supported by a legal [42] and technical framework [18] that gives it a wide reach.

#### Metadata in SGM

In SGM protocols, we can informally divide sensitive information into the following three layers:
![](https://static.meri.garden/4324d4031f8ba1bd35581892c7f37ea5.png)
Securing the 1st layer is the default goal of any SGM protocol; exchanging messages in an E2EE fashion is only possible if secure group secret keys* are shared among the group. Since the server is not considered an endpoint of the conversation, state-of-the-art SGM protocols aim at protecting the 1st layer from the server. 

\* There could either be a unique group secret key shared among the entire group as in MLS or multiple group secret keys, where different segments of the keys are shared among different members of the group as in Signal to perform pairwise communications

The 2nd and 3rd layers together constitute the **metadata**. Since ==they help the server to ensure the functionality of the SGM protocol==, they are often only encrypted using a transport layer encryption protocol (like TLS or Noise [ 52 ]) between the server and the participants. In this case, ==the server has access to this information and may expose it if legally compelled==, as discussed earlier. 

The 2nd layer captures any **static metadata** that is explicitly leaked from the content transmitted over the channel. For instance, the exchanged content may explicitly include the ==identity of the sender== in the clear or the ==identity of a member being added==, as in e.g. vanilla Signal [45] and MLSPlaintext [14]. Static metadata are also defined as a collection of sender information and handshake messages in the MLS standard draft [14, Sec. 10.1]. 

The 3rd layer captures any **dynamic metadata** that is implicitly leaked from ==the access pattern between group members and the server== via the communication channel. For example, in ==MLSCiphertext that hides up to the 2nd layer, users connect to the server using a non-anonymous protocol such as TLS==. Then, since the user implicitly identifies itself to the server via the channel, the server learns the group member’s identities (and how many times each member accessed) by observing the users accessing the same group identity. In particular, this happens regardless of protecting the 2nd layer metadata. To hide the user identity on the channel, users can use anonymous protocols (e.g., Tor [1 , 31 ]) instead. However, even if an anonymous protocol is used when a user fetches information about a group they belong to, the exact subset of accessed information may be correlated to this user’s identity. This may for example be the case for SGM protocols that arrange group members in complex data structures such as trees. ==Specifically, hiding the metadata only at the 2nd layer while using anonymous channels is insufficient since similar information may be inferred from the 3rd layer==, which incorporates all implicit leakages of dynamic metadata. 

In this work, only when all three layers are secured do we say that an SGM protocol is metadata-hiding.\*

\* ==Note that there are other types of metadata we can consider such as access timing [ 46 ] and geolocation of users.==

#### Existing metadata-hiding SGM

Existing SGM protocols and the level of layers they protect are depicted in Tab. 1. Signal recently proposed a metadata-hiding SGM protocol that we call **Private Groups** [ 3 ]. This is an extension of **Sealed Sender** [ 2 ] — a metadata-hiding two-user secure messaging protocol. The main building block of Private Groups is an efficient ==MAC-based keyed-verification anonymous credential (KVAC)== [24] that leverages the specific properties of tools from classical group-based cryptography, such as the [[ElGamal]] PKE and Schnorr PoK. While there is no formal security proof for Signal’s vanilla SGM, recently Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha [25] proposed a new security model to capture exactly the metadata layers (2nd & 3rd layers) and provided a partial security proof of Private Groups.

![](https://static.meri.garden/70db11b13d493d229a386f2dbaa42448.png)

==MLS [14] comes in two variants: MLSPlaintext and MLSCiphertext, each corresponding to protocols protecting the 1st and 1st & 2nd layers, respectively.== The security of MLSPlaintext has been scrutinized over the past few years [8, 9 , 12 , 17 , 19] and we now have a good understanding of it. However, ==no formal security proof for MLSCiphertext is known==. Moreover, unlike Signal’s Private Groups, constructing any variant of MLS that further hides the dynamic metadata is unanswered. Considering that dynamic metadata leaks part of, if not all, static metadata, MLSCiphertext may be leaking more metadata in practice than ideally expected.

### 1.1 Goal of This Work

In this work, we focus on continuous group key agreement ([[Continuous Group Key Agreement|CGKA]]) — an abstraction that captures the core protocol underlying the MLS protocol, i.e., [[TreeKEM]] [16], and many other MLS-inspired SGM protocols [5, 8– 12, 30 , 36 , 41].\* In brief, CGKA allows an evolving group of users to agree on a continuous sequence of group secret keys. Other than the simple function of sharing a group secret key, CGKA further models the strong notions of forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) [7, 28 , 29], which allow to greatly limit the scope of a compromise. 

\* To be accurate, MLS was inspired by asynchronous ratchet trees (ART) [30].

In a nutshell, a CGKA works as follows (see also Fig. 1):\* ==A group member may either (a) add a new member, (b) remove a member, and/or (c) update its keys== by sending a ==proposal p==. In an arbitrary interval, a group member may ==download the list of proposals $\vec{p} = \{ p_𝑖 \}_𝑖$ from the server and take them into effect by transmitting a commit c — this creates a new epoch where the group state is updated according to $\vec{p}$.== Importantly, a commit also updates the group secret key to achieve PCS.

\* We base the explanation on the ==most recent iterations of TreeKEM (i.e., after version 8 on MLS) following a “propose-and-commit” flow.==

![](https://static.meri.garden/21f3c683e9d85d1194eb69b622970411.png)
*why is gid not considered static metadata? maybe it only becomes useful metadata when it is associated with user ids, so idp and idc are the focus here. the server would be able to identify some information about gids either way though* 

A proposal p consists of five elements: (i) a string **gid** identifying the group; (ii) a counter **epoch** that specifies the current group state; (iii) the identity $id_p$ of the member creating p; (iv) a string **act** specifying whether p corresponds to (a), (b), or (c); and (v) other information typically required for authentication. A commit c has a similar structure, where $id_c$ denotes the committer and $ct_{key}$ is a ciphertext encrypting a key used to update the group secret. 

As depicted in Fig. 1, key is the 1st layer information, and any other static information included in p and c other than (gid, epoch) belong to the 2nd layer. ==Here, (gid, epoch) needs to be clear so that the receiver can download the appropriate p and c from the server.== In the past few years, we have seen several increasingly stronger or different types (e.g., game-based, simulation-based) of security models for CGKA [5, 8– 12 , 19 , 37 , 41 , 57], however these models only capture security at the 1st layer. ==Although it is straightforward to construct a CGKA that intuitively secures the 2nd layer once a group secret key is established, it is not clear whether this intuition is correct.== Indeed, MLSPlaintext has undergone 13 iterations, and formal security analyses of the 1st layer [8, 12] uncovered some subtle bugs. Thus, our first goal is the following: 

**(G1)** Propose a security model capturing the security of the 1st & 2nd layers and prove the security of existing CGKAs. 

As discussed above, securing the 2nd layer alone is insufficient. At first glance, it is tempting to replace the use of TLS for client-server communication with a client-anonymized authenticated channel (e.g., VPN or an anonymized proxy such as Tor [1 , 31]) in order to hide the 3rd layer. Unfortunately, this introduces another issue since, ==without any authentication on the client side, any adversary who knows (gid, epoch) can upload arbitrary garbage proposals and commits to the server, causing a denial of service (DoS) against the group==. It could be possible to rely on the efficient MAC-based KVAC used by Signal’s Private Groups [3], however, their construction is highly limited to a classical, pre-quantum setting, and the security proof is in the generic group model [55]. Considering the modularity of the vanilla Signal and the MLS protocol, having a generic construction that can be efficiently instantiated from versatile assumptions, including but not limited to post-quantum assumptions, is highly desirable. ==Of independent interest, we note that in the face of a compromise or removal of a group member, Private Groups must restart a new group [25]. It remains an interesting problem to construct a protocol that offers any (non-trivial) PCS.== *what's the difference, security-wise?* This brings us to our second goal: 

**(G2)** Propose an ==efficient and generic metadata-hiding CGKA achieving the same level of FS and PCS offered by existing non-metadata-hiding CGKAs==. 

Finally, Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha [25] proposed a security model capturing the 2nd & 3rd layers of Signal. However, it does not capture the 1st layer of security, i.e., confidentiality and integrity of exchanged messages, nor the notion of PCS. Moreover, this model is tailored to the specific construction of Signal’s Private Groups [3] and seems unfit for CGKA. Thus, we arrive at our final goal: 

**(G3)** Propose a ==security model for metadata-hiding CGKA==. 

### 1.2 Our Contributions 

#### UC model for the 2nd layer

We propose the first security model of CGKA capturing the security of the 2nd layer, i.e., static metadata. Our security model extends the state-of-the-art [[Universal composability|universal composability]] (UC) security model used by Alwen et al. [12] and Hashimoto et al. [36] to analyze TreeKEM version 10 in MLS and Chained CmPKE, respectively — we denote the ideal functionality as $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$.\* The main new ingredients we introduce are ==leakage functions that allow us to formally model the leaked static metadata (e.g., sender’s identity) from the proposals and commits==. Similar to the state-of-the-art ideal functionalities, ours captures a strong model where active adversaries can tamper with or inject messages, and malicious insiders can invite malicious members to the group and arbitrarily fork the group state. With this formalization effort, we answer the first half of **(G1)**, see Sec. 3 for details. 

> \* The subscript “ctxt” is inspired by the protocol name MLSCiphertext

#### Chained $CmPKE^{ctxt}$ UC-realizes $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$

We prove that a ciphertext variant of [[A Concrete Treatment of Efficient Continuous Group Key Agreement via Multi-Recipient PKEs|Chained CmPKE]] by Hashimoto et al. [36], coined as Chained $CmPKE^{ctxt}$, UC-realizes the ideal functionality $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$.\* Considering the ==similarity between Chained CmPKE and TreeKEM==, we believe the ciphertext variant of TreeKEM can also be proven secure following a similar proof. ==The reason why we focused on the former is that it is in some sense a generalization of the latter — it allows members to selectively download updates from the server, also known as [[Server-Aided Continuous Group Key Agreement|filtered CGKA]] [11].== This generalization allows obtaining a concretely efficient CGKA even in the post-quantum regime, which otherwise could be quite inefficient [36 ]. This security proof addresses the second half of (G1), see Sec. 3 for details.

> \* This variation mirrors what MLSCiphertext does to MLSPlaintext, in the sense that it encrypts the static metadata by applying a layer of encryption.

#### UC model for the 3rd layer

We propose ==the first UC security model of CGKA capturing the security of the 3rd layer, i.e., group access pattern — we denote the ideal functionality as $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$.== Any CGKA that UC-realizes $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ is a metadata-hiding CGKA. The model captures the fact that ==a group member performing an upload or download remains anonymous and unlinkable from the server==, while also ==restricting non-group members from accessing the group contents==. To formalize the latter property, our ideal functionality $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ captures an ==honest-but-curious server== for the first time. All prior models only considered malicious servers so it was not possible to define a “correct” behavior of the server, i.e., shutting out non-group members. $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ allows the adversary to corrupt the server, in which case it becomes identical to $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ defined above. This answers (G3), see Sec. 5 for details. 

#### A generic and efficient protocol UC-realizing $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$

We provide a simple and generic wrapper protocol $𝑊^{mh}$ that UC-realizes $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ in the $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$-hybrid model. Specifically, given an arbitrary CGKA $Π_{ctxt}$ that UC-realizes $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$, $𝑊^{mh}$ in composition with $Π_{ctxt}$ UC-realizes $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$. ==Unlike Signal’s Private Groups, we do not rely on complex tools such as a MAC-based KVAC==, whose known efficient instantiations require classical group-based assumptions. Our key insight is ==to leverage the unique group secret key shared among the members (which is non-existing in Signal) to perform a proof of membership to the server==. The concrete construction of our wrapper protocol only requires a standard signature scheme, which can be efficiently instantiated using either classical or post-quantum assumptions. Our metadata-hiding CGKA inherits all the FS and PCS properties satisfied by the underlying CGKA satisfying $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$. For instance, using MLSCiphertext as the underlying CGKA, the upload cost of a key update of our metadata-hiding CGKA can be 𝑂 (log 𝑁 ), as opposed to 𝑂 (𝑁 ) for Private Groups. This provides a theoretic answer to **(G2)**, see Sec. 4 for details. 

#### Instantiation and efficiency analysis

We provide concrete instantiations of our protocols under either classical or post-quantum assumptions. We then study the bandw$id_t$h impact of $𝑊^{mh}$ when applied to Chained $CmPKE^{ctxt}$. The impact of $𝑊^{mh}$ is moderate, as it never increases the bandw$id_t$h cost of the principal operations (“update”, “add” and “remove” proposals, as well as commit or application messages) by more than a factor of two. In practice, the concrete overhead may be even lower. This illustrates that our notion of metadata-hiding CGKA can be realized at a moderate cost. This covers the efficiency aspects of (G2), see Sec. 6.2 for details. 

#### Statistical leakage from metadata-hiding CGKA

Our security model allows us to prove that a CGKA UC-realizes an ideal functionality $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ with respect to a specific leakage function, which defines any ==inherent metadata leakage that cannot be hidden==. What the adversary can learn from this leakage function is another question. 

We initiate a discussion on the nature and extent of the information that can be inferred from this leakage. We study several CGKAs [5, 11 , 12 , 36 , 41] and find that ==all of them leak information through the size of protocol messages (welcome, proposal and/or commit)==, sometimes in surprising and indirect ways. At this point, we emphasize that the authors of these protocols never claimed them to be metadata-hiding, so this leakage does not reflect the shortcomings of the designs. We believe that a systematic study of this leakage, as well as proposing countermeasures to provably mitigate it, constitutes a valuable and exciting research direction. For now, this discussion explores the limitations of (G3), see Sec. 7 for details.

#### Limitations

We would like to clarify the limitations of this work. First, we only consider the CGKA aspect of SGMs. While it is believed that CGKA captures the essence of SGMs — which is supported by the vast amount of research focusing solely on CGKA [5, 8– 12 , 19 , 36 , 41 , 57] — to argue a provably secure metadata-hiding SGM, we would need to extend our security model to cover the message exchanging layer as well. It was only recently that a security model that captures the entire SGM at the 1st layer was proposed [9]. Second, our security model and protocol ==do not prevent an adversary from anonymously registering numerous fake groups on the server==. We only prevent an outsider from accessing an existing group. Technically, this seems efficiently solvable using standard anonymous credentials [26 ] and we leave it as future work to incorporate these into our security model. ==Finally, metadata outside the scope of our models, such as access timing [46] and device fingerprinting, may circumvent the privacy guarantees provided by a metadata-hiding CGKA.==

## 2 Background

We now provide some background on the existing definition of CGKA that models the default security of the 1st layer, i.e., *group secret key*.\* In this work, we focus on CGKA defined in the UC framework. With the nice composability property, we will be able to construct a metadata-hiding CGKA in a modular manner. 

> \* As mentioned in Sec. 1.2, CGKA only captures the security of the group secret key k. The message, also included in the 1st layer, is handled by a different protocol. Roughly, the messages are sent through E2EE using the established k.

Due to page limitation, we refer the readers to App. B for some background on the UC framework and a formal definition of the ideal functionality $F_{CGKA}$ capturing the UC security of the 1st layer.

### 2.1 Syntax of CGKA

All the group members internally store the group identifier gid, the current epoch of the group, the current group secret key, and information to identify the current members. Moreover, each member (roughly) stores a public key whose associated secret key is known only to themselves. This is called the *key material*. 

Members can upload *proposals* p to the server, which can take on three types: addition or removal of some members, and update of key materials. Members can download any subset of these proposals $\vec{p}$ at an arbitrary interval to create a *commit* c. Any members can then process this commit to update their group state to the next epoch according to the content of the proposals that were committed. The group secret key is always updated after a process — if every group member’s key material was uncompromised at that epoch, then this effectively heals the group and offers PCS. 

In this work, we follow the syntax of Hashimoto et al. [36 ] (which extends the syntax of Alwen et al. [ 12]) that models selective downloading. This allows the members to only download part of the commit required to move to the next epoch. Specifically, a commit c is divided into $(c_0, \vec{c})$, where $c_0$ is the member-*independent* commit and $\vec{c}$ = $(\hat{c}_{id})$id is the list of member-dependent commit. Member id only needs to download $(c_0, \hat{c}_{id})$ from the server to ad- vance its epoch. Here, we assume there is a canonical ordering of the group members, and member id requests its index in the list $\vec{c}$ to the server to download $\vec{c}$ \[index] = $\hat{c}_{id}$. Such selective downloading can bring great efficiency gain — especially in the post-quantum regime where asymmetric ciphertexts tend to be much larger than classical ones (see [ 36 ] for further motivations). This formalization was later coined as [[Server-Aided Continuous Group Key Agreement|filtered CGKA]] [11]. 

Informally, CGKA is defined by the following algorithms, where we assume id is the executing party and omit it from the input. 
- **Group Creation (Create)**: It initializes a new group state with party id as the only member.8 
- **Proposals (Propose**, act) → p : It outputs a proposal p for the *action* **act** that can take on the value ‘add’-$id_𝑡$ , ‘rem’-$id_𝑡$ , or ‘upd’ . The first two actions dictate the adding or removal of $id_𝑡$ . The last updates id’s key material. 
- **Commit (Commit**, $\vec{p}$) → $(c_0, \vec{c}, \vec{𝑤})$: It commits a vector of proposals ®p and outputs a commit ($c_0$, ®c). $c_0$ is a member-independent commit while ®c = (bcid′ )id′ is a list of member-dependent commits, where |®c| is equal to the current group size. If ®p contains an add proposal, then it outputs a welcome message ®𝑤 = (b𝑤$id_t$ )$id_t$ , where $id_t$ denotes the added members.9 
- **Process (Process**, $c_0, \hat{c}_{id}, \vec{p}$): It processes a commit ($c_0$,bcid) with the associated proposals ®p, and advances id’s internal group state to the next epoch. 
- **Join (Join**, $\hat{𝑤}_{id}$): It allows id to join the group using the welcome message b𝑤id. id’s group state is synced with any member who processes the commit made at the same epoch. 
- **Key (Key) → k**: It outputs the current group secret key k.

## 3 HIDING STATIC METADATA IN CGKA

As a first step, we propose a UC security model capturing the security of the 1st & 2nd layers (i.e., group secret keys and static metadata) by defining a new ideal functionality $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$. Similarly to the safe predicate used in FCGKA to control the levels of FS and PCS, $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ comes with five leakage functions allowing to control the amount of static metadata leaked from create group, proposal, commit, process, and join. By defining the leakage functions to leak all the static metadata, then $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ (essentially) recovers the prior ideal functionality $F_{CGKA}$.

We then prove that a ciphertext variant of Hashimoto et al.’s Chained CmPKE [36 ] satisfies $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$, where the leakage functions are defined to only leak the minimal static metadata matching our intuition. 

### 3.1 UC Security Model for Static Metadata 

$F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ has the same user interface (or syntax) as $F_{CGKA}$. The only difference is how the internals of the ideal functionalities are defined. The full details on $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ is provided in App. B. Below, we explain the two main points at which $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ differs from $F_{CGKA}$. 

#### Modeling static metadata leakage. 

Recall how $F_{CGKA}$ defined the ideal proposal function (see Fig. 2). When a party id is invoked on (Propose, act) from the environment Z, $F_{CGKA}$ informs the adversary A with (Propose, gid, epoch, id, act). A then simulates a proposal p. This models the fact that p in the real world is allowed to leak information on (gid, epoch), the party id creating p, and the type of proposal act ∈ { ‘add’-$id_t$ , ‘rem’-$id_t$ , ‘upd’ } included in p. 

We control the amount of such leakage from p by a leakage function \*leak-prop. Informally, \*leak-prop takes as input the identity id of the member creating the proposal and the current epoch. In case safe is false at epoch, \*leak-prop outputs all the static metadata since the group secret key is compromised at that epoch. Otherwise, it only outputs the static metadata the CGKA is allowed to leak. For example, to model MLSCiphertext, we define \*leak-prop(id, epoch) to only output (gid, epoch, |id| , |act|) when safe is true, where |act| leaks the size of the action included in p. In case every member identity $id_t$ is encoded in the same bit-length, then this implies for instance that p does not leak who created the p and who was added and removed. 

Similarly to \***leak-prop**, we define four more leakage functions \***leak-create**, \***leak-proc**, \***leak-com**, and \***leak-wel**. For instance, the last two controls the amount of static metadata leaked from commits and welcome messages, respectively. Unlike proposals, the static metadata that is inherently leaked from commits and welcome messages differs between CGKAs. Thus, care is required when formally defining them. For instance, in MLSCiphertext, a welcome message for member $id_t$ includes a hash of $id_t$ ’s key package $kp_{id_𝑡}$ (i.e., key materials used by $id_t$ ). To model this fact, \*leak-wel must also output kp$id_t$ to the adversary (see App. C.2 for more discussion). Another subtlety is that the size of a commit in MLSCiphertext is dictated by how many blank nodes exist in the tree. In Sec. 7, we discuss the real-world consequences of these inherent leakages of static metadata. 

#### Using semantics for nodes in history graphs. 

In this work, we update the prior definition of history graphs to use the semantics of a transcript to identify the nodes in a history graph. That is, we identify a node by a counter that informally counts the number of group operations leading to the node. In previous works [ 12 , 36 ] (which did not capture the security of the static metadata), each node was identified by the value of the non-encrypted member- independent commit $c_0$. Since $c_0$ uniquely defined an epoch and group state, it made intuitive sense to identify each node by $c_0$. 

Unfortunately, this intuition is lost when we try to further secure the static metadata. This is because $c_0$ is now an encryption of the actual commit content. Namely, there can be two distinct $c_0$ and $c^`_0$ that decrypt to the same commit content. While we would like to assign different members processing $c_0$ and $c^`_0$ to the same node in the history graph, it is not clear which $c_0$ and $c^`_0$ to use to identify the node. Such an issue disappears by using the semantics since the group operation defined inside $c_0$ and $c^`_0$ are identical. 

Independently, Alwen et al. [ 11 ] also uses the semantics to define nodes in their security model. This was crucial to capture a more advanced form of (non-metadata-hiding) CGKA coined as server-aided CGKA. 

#### Restricted adversary due to commitment problem. 

In the UC framework, it is typical to restrict the adversary A from performing corruptions that would cause the so-called *commitment problem*. Informally, this is a type of attack where A can adaptively choose to corrupt some states after being provided with some challenges with respect to the state. While this attack is prohibited by default in any natural game-based definition (e.g., the adversary cannot obtain a secret key after being provided the challenge ciphertext), we need to make this restriction explicit in the UC-based definition. 

Compared to prior works in the UC framework [10 , 12 , 36 ], the description of the restriction we require is more strict. Previously, when a new node was created due to a commit, the predicate **safe** was undefined for that node. Roughly, this is because the group secret key inside that node was never explicitly used during the real protocol and A was given the freedom to adaptively decide whether to corrupt that node at an arbitrary moment of the security game. However, in the static metadata-hiding setting, this freedom of the adversary needs to be restricted. This is because ==when a new node is created, the group secret key inside this node is explicitly used to encrypt the static metadata of the commit content==. When **safe** is true at this node, the ideal functionality $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ (roughly) wants to assign a random ciphertext to model the fact that the commit does not leak any information. Since A is explicitly given the ciphertext, it cannot later decide to corrupt the node (i.e., safe remains true), as otherwise, it could trivially distinguish a valid ciphertext from a random one.

## 5 Formal model for metadata-hiding CGKA

We define a UC security model capturing the security of the entire 1st, 2nd & 3rd layers (i.e., group secret keys, static and dynamic metadata) by defining a new ideal functionality $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$. Any CGKA UC-realizing $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ is provably a metadata-hiding CGKA. Reusing most of the description of $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ handling the 1st and 2nd layers, the description of $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ can focus mainly on the 3rd layer. Our model succinctly captures all the properties explained in Sec. 4.1, Items (1) to (5). We then show that the wrapper protocol 𝑊 mh presented in the previous section UC-realizes $F^{mh}_{CGKA}$ in the $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$-hybrid model. The full details of this section is provided in App. D. Below, we provide an overview of our idea.

### 5.1 Modeling an Honest but Curious Sever 

In previous constructions of CGKA, the server was assumed to be always malicious. This is for instance captured in the ideal functionalities $F_{CGKA}$ and $F^{ctxt}_{CGKA}$ by observing that the Commit and Process take as input arbitrary proposals and commits — not just those created by the honest group members. While assuming the server to be always malicious allows to capture a strong level of security against group secret keys and static metadata, this is far too inflexible for our use case. Recall Sec. 4.1, Item (4). To properly model that any non-member cannot upload and download from the server on behalf of the group, we must model an honest but curious server — a server that honestly follows the protocol but tries to learn as much metadata as possible. To this end, we explicitly incorporate a server into our model as depicted in Fig. 6. We allow the server to be in two states: honest16 or corrupt. When the server is honest, we are able to properly model Sec. 4.1, Item (4). Otherwise, since a malicious server can arbitrarily choose to accept or reject the identification protocol executed by the wrapper protocol 𝑊 mh, 𝑊 mh does not provide any meaningful functionality. ==In particular, our metadata-hiding CGKA Πctxt CGKA degenerates to offer the same functionality as F ctxt CGKA.==
