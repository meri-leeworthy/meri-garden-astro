          Meri has been a dream to work with! Clear, prompt and honest
          communication, with good advice when dealing with our business
          that knows nothing about websites. We asked Meri to jump in on a
          half finished project toward the end of the year no less and she
          took it all onboard easily and quickly. Thanks so much for your
          help Meri, highly recommend!
